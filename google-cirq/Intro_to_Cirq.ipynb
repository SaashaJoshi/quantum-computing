        "[Cirq](https://github.com/quantumlib/cirq) is a framework for writing quantum algorithms for noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Roughly speaking, NISQ devices are those with O(100) qubits that can enact O(1000) gates.  Because the resources for NISQ devices are so constrained we believe that a framework for writing programs on these devices needs to be aware of all of the architectural properties of the device on which the algorithm is written. This is in contrast to other frameworks where there is a clean separation between the abstract model being used and the details of the device.  \n",
